Purpose of the analysis: Look into the food preferences of a sample of countries in terms of meat consumption. Have the trends of meat consumption been increasing or decreasing in the recent years?
 
How much pollution has the production of this meat caused according to the agricultural methane emissions levels recorded during the recent years?

Can we oberve a correlation between the meat consumption levels and the polution levels?

Datasets used in the analysis:

●	Agricultural methane emissions (thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent)
